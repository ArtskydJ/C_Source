If a SDL application is shared with someone, give them:

SDL.dll

==========
If the application has text in it, also give them:

libfreetype-6.dll

SDL_ttf.dll

zlib1.dll

==========
They should put these in the same dir as the .exe file.

If they want, they can put them in:

C:\Windows\System32\	(on 32 bit windows)

C:\Windows\SysWOW64\	(on 64 bit windows)
